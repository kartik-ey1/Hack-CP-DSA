Given a positive integer n and an integer k such that 0≤k≤n, find any permutation A of 1,2…n such that the number of indices for which Ai=i is exactly k. 
If there exists no such permutation, print −1. If there exist multiple such permutations, print any one of them.

Input Format
First line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers n,k.
Output Format
For each test case, print a permutation in a single line, if a permutation with the given constraints exists. Print −1 otherwise.

Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤n≤105
0≤k≤n
Sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed  2⋅106
